                        An old queen, whose husband had been dead some years, had a beautiful
                    daughter. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a
                    great way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she got
                    ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen, her
                    mother, packed up a great many costly things--jewels, and gold, and
                    silver, trinkets, fine dresses, and in short, everything that became a
                    royal bride; for she loved her child very dearly; and she gave her a
                    waiting-maid to ride with her, and give her into the bridegroom's hands;
                    and each had a horse for the journey. Now the princess' horse was called
                    Falada, and could speak.

                        When the time came for them to set out, the old queen went into her
                    bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair,
                    and gave it to her daughter, saying, "Take care of it, dear child; for
                    it is a charm that may be of use to you on the road." Then they took a
                    sorrowful leave of each other, and the princess put the lock of her
                    mother's hair into her bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her
                    journey to her bridegroom's kingdom.
